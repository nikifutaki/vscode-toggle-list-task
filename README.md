## Overview

"Toggle List and Task in Markdown" is a VS Code extension that allows you to toggle lists and tasks in a Markdown file. With this extension, you can easily manage tasks and lists within your Markdown file.

## Usage

To use this extension, follow these steps:

1. Open a Markdown file.
2. Select the line with the list or task that you want to toggle.
3. Press `Shift + Alt + c`.

If the selected line is a list or task, they will be toggled. If it's a task (- [ ] item), it will be changed to a list (- item), and if it's a list (- item), it will be changed to a task (- [ ] item).

You can also toggle multiple lines of lists and tasks at once. Simply execute the above steps for multiple lines to toggle them all at once.
